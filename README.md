3. Synchronization Between BE and Web
System Status Fields: Fields like reset_count, free_heap, temperature, inputs, outputs, and loraE32 are synchronized from BE to the web for display on index.html (Console, LoRa E32 Info).
Counter Configuration Fields: Fields planDisplay and counters are synchronized between dashboard.html and BE via saveConfig() and updateStatus().
LoRa Fields: Parameters like addh, addl, chan, etc., are sent from the web to BE for updates and returned from BE to reflect the current state.
Login Fields: username and password are sent from the web to BE for authentication, with the success result returned.
